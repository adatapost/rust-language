RUST Language
===
RUST is a new programming language for the programmers who need to "dip down" into low-level control without taking on the customary risk of crashes or security holes, and without having to learn the fine points of a fickle toolchain.

```rust
fn main() {
  print!("RUST");
  println!(" Language.");
  println!("Hello Rust!!!");
  println!("-------------------");
}
```
