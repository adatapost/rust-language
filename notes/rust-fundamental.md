RUST Language
===
RUST is a new programming language for the programmers who need to "dip down" into low-level control without taking on the customary risk of crashes or security holes, and without having to learn the fine points of a fickle toolchain.

In other words, a language that is designed to guide developers naturally towards reliable code that is efficient in terms of speed and memory usage.
